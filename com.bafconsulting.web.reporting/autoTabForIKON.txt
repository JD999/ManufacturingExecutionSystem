Hello all.

Is it possible to configure the barcode scanner on the IKON to trigger an event after a successful scan?

I want to apply a "TAB" after a successful read in a internet browser textfield.

The scanner is a Decoded(Intermec ISCP).

Thanks,

Chris

Good morning Chris and Welcome to the Community,

Have you considered configuring the scanner so a TAB suffix character is automatically added to the barcode data?

E.g.

Open up the Teklogix Scanners applet
Move to the Translations tabulation
Expand Case 1
Double-click No rule
Select Add barcode prefix/suffix
Click the Suffix edit box
Click [ Insert Key ]
Press the TAB key, then click [ OK ]

  

Press [ OK ] to save the new settings
I do hope this helps.
Kind regards,

Jacques
